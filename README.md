# ESP32 101
A beginner-friendly library that makes learning ESP32 fun and easy.

This library to help beginners learn about the ESP32 microcontroller and its capabilities. It includes simple projects that demonstrate how to use the ESP32 for various tasks, such as blinking an LED, reading sensors, and connecting to Wi-Fi.

There are four parts in this library:

1. **Introduction**: Explains why choose the ESP32 for learning, and setup the development environment and tools.
2. **Getting Started**: Provides simple projects to help you get familiar with the ESP32, such as blinking an LED and reading sensor data, connecting to Wi-Fi, controlling motors, and using sensors.
3. **Advanced Projects**: Allows you to explore more advanced projects such as tinyML applications, or chat with GPT or Google gemini.
4. **Optional Projects**: As you know the basics, you can explore more advanced projects that involve connecting to the internet, using cloud services, and building IoT applications via MQTT and HTTP, or some cloud services like Blynk, Adafruit IO, and ThingSpeak.
